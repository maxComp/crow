Last call at Ben's Crow Inn<br><br>

Ben's Crow Inn, 6781 E. Warm Springs Ave., will serve its last patrons on Oct. 9.
<br><br>
The venerable watering hole in East Boise has been doing business for 68 years, but owner Ben Hamilton is in the process of selling the property to a developer and has decided to call it quits.
<br><br>
"The first day I was open I took in 95 cents". He bought the Crow Inn in 1969 when he was 25 years old.<br><br>
In the early days, Ben said the menu consisted primarily of pizza and beer, and that many of his early customers were prison guards at what is now the Old Idaho State Penitentiary. <br><br>While he says he didn't know much about bartending or owning a restaurant at the time, he spent the next several decades making a name for himself and his tavern, located in east Boise near Highway 21. Now the Crow Inn is famous for its buckets of clams, fingersteaks and seafood.
<br><br>
Take a trip down memory lane for the last time. It's open 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. 
<br><br>
According to Ben this colorful establishment got its name from
 construction workers that often paused at this spot, 
for a breather en route to the Lucky Peak dam site in 1948.<br><br>
But peace and quiet were hard to come by.  Day by day,
week by week a raucous crow made it his duty to annoy them.<br><br>
When the roadside tavern opened, it seemed appropriate to christen
it after the feathered broadcaster.
